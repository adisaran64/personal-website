I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, holding degrees in applied mathematics and computer science. Thus far, I have written code as an undergraduate researcher, software engineering intern, and blockchain engineer. Although I am currently based in California, I have lived around the globe, from New York to Tokyo.

I am looking for early-career software engineering and/or quantitative analysis opportunities anywhere, feel free to get in touch.
